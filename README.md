# EDM Reviews

My thoughts on recently-released electronic dance music. Songs/albums marked with an asterisk (\*) are recommended.

Maybe one day, if I find time to figure out how to use a good API for song metadata, I'll throw this stuff into a dataset and see what can be done with it.

### May 6, 2022
* Don Diablo - Day & Nite

Atmospheric chill house with vocals from Kid Cudi's hit

* Elephante, Sabai - Love Again

Melodic future bass, pleasant vocals and energetic but not overbearing drop

* Jonas Blue, Sam Feldt - Endless Summer *

Progressive house, dark bassy drop, unexpected for Sam Feldt

* Kygo - Freeze *

Slow melodic piano intro before vocals over typical Kygo melody, interesting synth sound near drop as energy picks up

* Mr. Belt & Wezol - New Millenium *

House with sax riff, deep spoken word vocals, a mixed bag of sounds

* NUZB - Get Down

Mid-energy tech house gradually more ornamented by NUZB's trademark sounds

* Oliver Heldens, Nile Rodgers, House Gospel Choir - I Was Made For Loving You

Oliver Heldens' proven formula to turn a classic into a groovy future house tune

* Robin Schulz & David Guetta - On Repeat

Not the radio hit I expected nor a festival showstopper, low-key break before trance-influenced drop/chorus

* SIKS & Le Pedre ft. Kris Kiss - Let It Out All

Bassy bigroom with Kris Kiss' vocals

* Solardo - So Far So Good

Uptempo deep house with repeated synth melody

* Will Clarke - Mirage

Trancy intro but more techno-sounding drop with sounds suddenly stripped away

### Apr 29, 2022
* Chemical Surf - Satisfied

Sound reminds me of Vintage Culture, nice release of tension at the drop, don't like the vocals so much

* Dirty Palm - Priorities

Nice future house drop but transition slightly abrupt

* EDX - Holy Wood

Upbeat tribal house, nice percussions, vocals give way to energetic beat

* Hardwell - Black Magic

More bigroom techno/future rave from Hardwell

* KREAM - Once again

Similar style to previous releases except a bit of a darker vibe, low-energy but still danceable house

* MK & Paul Woolford feat Majid Jordan - Teardrops

Piano house, radio-friendly though the vocals at the drop could be more catchy

* MPH, Katie Bosworth - Waiting *

High tempo, bassy drop, unaggressive and danceable

* Nicky Romero - Pressure

Confusing bigroom-sounding start to drop quickly giving way back to uptempo tech house

* NØ SIGNE - Selection

Trap beat gives way to interesting drop, somewhat reminds me of Morgan J, interesting but lacking on cohesion

* Raven & Kreyn x BIGMOO - Welcome To The Future (feat. Jeonghyeon) *

High-energy release with some bass house influences, great fit for Hexagon, uninspiring lyrics one weak point

* Steve Aoki, HRVY - Save Me

Radio-friendly dance pop with Brazilian bass drop

* Tiësto, Deorro - Savage

Slight change to Five Hours' melody with new vocals, strings, bigger drop

* Malaa - Wait (Kenty Clide remix) *

Darker intro with big buildup and switchup at drop into house with cowbells?

* Malaa - Wait (YYVNG remix)

Interesting club-friendly take on the track, more housy and less aggressive drop, but synths in buildup kind of offputting

* Martin Garrix - Sentio (Album) *

One fantastic collaboration after another, references to a variety of Martin Garrix's bigroom sounds over the years, emotional finish in If We'll Ever Be Remembered, album is an instant classic

### Apr 22, 2022
* Alesso & Zara Larsson - Words

Pop dance, less focus on darker-sounding drop

* Asketa & Natan Chaim - Somebody *

Acoustic intro before progressive house with good momentum, would be even more effective without the lyrics from Gotye's Somebody That I Used To Know

* AVIRA - Surrender

Techno, somewhat industrial-sounding but mostly pleasant, nice vocals

* Cheat Codes - Tell Me You Love Me

Typical Brazilian Bass, pop vocals with bassline making the song danceable although not very energetic

* Chico Rose - Losing my Religion

Not an R.E.M. remake like I expected, midtempo dance pop

* Dillon Francis, Valentino Khan - Move It *

I Like To Move It melody turned into tech house, aggressive buildup stands out a bit too much, good variation with the vocals

* Ferry Corsten - Timeout

Well-known vocals, upbeat house with some nice synths

* Firebeatz - Don't stop moving

Firebeatz's unique synth sound, upbeat house, radio-friendly but not quite memorable enough to be a hit

* Harris & Ford, Bassjackers - Psycho *

Inspired by Melbourne Shuffle but surprisingly inaggressive for Bassjackers, good momentum but some sudden transitions

* Maddix - Culture

Driving techno tune with long pause at drop for suspense, slightly annoying repeated high note and weird transition halfway into more melodic section

* Martin Garrix, Justin Mylo, Dewain Whitmore - Find You

Great acoustic vocals, festival progressive house, change in atmosphere at drop a bit jarring

* Nirvana - Something In The Way (Illenium Remix)

A complete twist on the original Nirvana sound, buidlup development gives a sense of chaos, slow trap drop, not as melodic or ornamental as I might have liked

* Ofenbach - 4U

Pop dance, marginally danceable but improves with second drop

* Oomloud - It's tricky

Run-D.M.C's hit turned into a club-friendly house track

* Steff da Campo - Hot in here (Öwnboss Remix)

House original twisted into Brazilian bass drop

* Swanky Tunes - Never look back

Long intro before groovy radio-friendly beat

* Valy Mo - Mess *

Tech house, interesting start to drop, second drop turns towards a more techno-y vibe for a while

* Vintage Culture & Goodboys - This Feeling

Repetitive vocals, melodic house but not as atmospheric as Vintage Culture's recent hits 

### Apr 15, 2022
* Bruno Be - Soldiers

Trap rhythm, dark atmosphere, nice buildup and Brazilian bass-y drop

* Funkin Matt - Neo *

Similar to Funkin Matt's other recent releases, unique sound while sticking to house beat

* Guz - In my Bones

Tech house, nice beat, thankfully some novel vocals

* Hardwell - F\*cking Society

Bigroom sound, wouldn't really anywhere but festival sets

* Jay Hardway - My Sweet Heaven (Chill Mix)

Soothing chorus vocals over piano slowed-down house melody

* Justus - Tunnel

Future rave with some experimentation with the rhythm, I find the buildup too noisy

* Laidback Luke, Eva Simons - Flexin'

House, not boring but not too memorable either, the second drop is a highlight

* Martin Garrix, DubVision, Shaun Farrugia - Starlight (Keep Me Afloat)

Martin Garrix maintains a string of solid releases, clear Dubvision influence in festival progressive house drop

* Mr. Belt & Wezol - Genesis

Almost slap house but leans towards Mr. Belt & Wezol's typical future house sound

* NUZB & Noola - Like That

Nothing wrong here, but feels too similar to NUZB's previous releases

* Seth Hills - For U

Hard to classify, maybe inaggressive bass house, energy somewhere between chill and festival

* Seven Lions, Blastoyz - Reason for Fighting *

Everything from psytrance to melodic trap thrown into one track, starts slow and unimposing, builds up to psytrance/hardstyle drop with some dubstep sounds introduced, brief before trap second drop and then a return to psytrance at the end

* Swedish House Mafia - Paradise Again (Album) *

Pop and rap interspersed with ventures into house, my favourite maybe Zonderling-inspired Time

### Apr 8, 2022
* Angemi - Hate you

Dance pop, dominant vocals, some bass and synths, energy weirdly fades in second half of chorus

* Armin van Buuren - Come around again

Pop-sounding track but nice buildup to drop with slap house influences

* Bingo Players - State of Mind (Guz Remix)

Great buildup that ends a bit anticlimactically, good momentum throughout despite darker atmosphere

* Habstrakt, Nitepunk - Point

Bass house drop a bit too aggressive for my taste, especially the first one, but gets better

* Julian Calor, Trøves - Find my way *

Classic example of what Mo Falk would call "Colour house", the different buildup second time around adds a dimension

* Marc Benjamin - Edge of Paradise

Prototypical festival progressive house, found a suitable home at Protocal

* Marnik - Across the Sun

Slightly slowed-up Melbourne bounce/shuffle, nothing too special

* Martin Garrix, Brooks - Quantum *

Reminiscent of their classic collaborations, energetic drops, missing vocals or something else before first drop but interesting variation in sounds before second drop

* Matroda - Wasting Time

Piano house buildup leads to tech house drop, some bassy synths added in for ornamentation

* ÖWNBOSS, Sevek - Move Your Body (Tiesto Edit)

Tiesto's brand name slapped onto the song, with a few additions/changes to the original

* RudeLies - Moundé

Interesting venture into the deep house space

* SMACK, Swanky Tunes - Ready or not *

Energetic bass house drop, just wish they didn't use oversampled vocals in the breaks

### Apr 1, 2022
* Alok, Bastille - Run Into Trouble

Radio-friendly pop track with groovy baseline and some more experimental sounds in the second half of the chorus

* Curbi & Mike Cervello - Deja Vu *

Base house with good variety from minimalist to more crowded-sounding parts in drop

* Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike & Vini Vici & MATTN - Cafe Del Mar

Psytrance remake of classic melody, no risks taken

* Gryffin, One Republic - You Were Loved

Decent radio-friendly pop track, acoustic and raw intro

* Hardwell - Broken Mirror / Into The Unknown

A spooky-sounding festival intro followed by a future rave track with a gradual buildup of energy

* Jack Wins - Queen

House beat with lyrics from Billy Ocean's Caribbean Queen repeated on top

* Lucas & Steve, Marf - Give Me Your Love *

Medley of Mike Williams and Avicii's sounds in Lucas & Steve's niche style

* Martin Garrix, Mesto - Limitless *

Mesto-sounding drop but with more bass house influence, festival-oriented but enjoyable in other settings too

* Will Sparks - Say It Again *

Somewhere between bass house and psytrance or bigroom, energy just right

* Justin Mylo & Jay Mason - Used to be Better

Future bounce track with confusingly aggressive sections

* Julian Jordan & Alan Shirahama - Facts

Julian Jordan's usual bass house song, nothing too special

* Sofi Tukker - Kakee

Western-sounding guitar riff underneath foreign lyrics, not super danceable

* Flume & Caroline Polachek - Sirens *

Very high vocals with Flume's unique sound design shining through, an unusual rhythm that is out-of-place at first but gradually brings the song together

* Diplo & Miguel - Don't Forget My Love (John Summit Remix) *

An energetic yet melodic house remix that I can see being played in a lot of sets

### Mar 25, 2022

+ Alesso - Only you

Classic festival progressive house, vocals don't fit melody as well which makes the song less memorable

+ Dannic - Get over you

String section in verses leads to light g-house drop

+ Jack Back - Feeling

Tech house, good momentum, set-friendly

+ Jonas Blue, Sevenn - Angles

Awkward shifts in sound at a few moments, not super high-energy but not really melodic either

+ MaRLo, Achilles - Nothing Is Left

Bigroom trance, not sure how original it is

+ Martin Garrix & Zedd - Follow

Martin Garrix going back to his older big room sound, vocals only introduced after first drop put focus on instrumental

+ Mike Williams - Pretty Little Words

Gradual buildup of energy into a heavy future bounce drop that could have brought more creativity

+ Nicky Romero - Lose my Mind *

Tech house with some interesting elements, atypical Nicky Romero track

+ Nora En Pure - Tribe of Kindness *

Uplifting melodic house with nostalgic atmosphere, pleasant listen

+ Plastik Funk - Vroom Vroom

Bass house drop that I find too aggressive because of an inadequate buildup

+ Sick Individuals - Maki

Video-game sound turns into big room with unusual percussion-heavy drop

+ Timmy Trumpet, KSHMR - Ininna Tora

Repetitive vocal, somewhere between big room and Melbourne bounce, nothing to see here

+ Voost - This Feeling *

Piano house, upbeat uptempo drop

+ Yves V - Deja Vu

Slap house, not much originality

+ Dom Dolla - Strangers (with Mansionair) (Tinlicker Remix) *

Nice melodic take on Dom Dolla's tech house track, future rave influences but not aggressive

+ Firebeatz, Stefy De Cicco - Everybody's Got To Learn Sometime (Extended Mix) *

Piano house verse with groovy bass house-style drop

### Mar 18, 2022

+ Bleu Clair - Mistake *

Smooth house drop into pleasant string melody

+ Chocolate Puma - Frenzy *

Bass house with industrial-sounding percussion at drop

+ Endor - El Cuervo

Latin-inspired tune, Spanish vocals over house rhythm

+ HI-LO, Eli Brown - Industria

Typical HI-LO sound especially at second drop, slightly darker vibe than usual, synths in middle section provide some variety

+ Joel Corry, David Guetta, Bryson Tiller – What Would You Do?

Radio-friendly, Joel Corry's dance pop sound, not super memorable

+ Mabel x Jax Jones x Galantis - Good Luck

Promising start with good vocals, picks up energy effectively, heavier Jax Jones influence, drop/chorus not energetic enough to make this a real hit

+ Matt Nash - Into the Light *

Distinct Matt Nash sound, deep house inspiration but upbeat enough to keep you moving

+ Redondo - High on Emotion

Lively piano house to keep sets energetic, not much experimentation but a proven formula. Reminds me of Martin Ikin - Ready To Dance

+ Sandro Silva - Bulldog

Somewhere between big room and hardstyle but a slightly unusual drop that might be hard to dance to

+ Steve Aoki - Stop the World *

Energetic but unaggressive drop, friendly for festival sets with the energy really going down in the verses for some recovery

+ Tujamo - Click

Rap vocals over otherwise typical Tujamo vibes, nothing too special

+ Vintage Culture - Commotion *

Vocalist from Faithless's singer, Vintage Culture's prototypical melodic/deep house sound that is dark yet carries good momentum

+ Afrojack, Chico Rose, Dubvision, Manse - Stay With You

Typical festival progressive house buildup and vocals, nostalgic if unoriginal sound

+ DJ Fresh - Gold Dust (Fox Stevenson Remix) *

Clean head-bopping drum-n-bass with simple melody, no complaints

+ Michael Sparks - Tell Me *

Bass house, funky drop, vocal repetition slightly annoying, Zonderling-style sound in breaks

+ Kungs - Club Azur (Album)

Exemplifies Kungs' groovy house/Nu Disco fusion sound, an easy listen though less variety than hoped for

### Mar 11, 2022

+ Angemi - Rock the Boat

Danceable club-friendly house track, wished for more energy

+ Armin van Buuren x R3HAB - Love We Lost

Festival-friendly bigroom energy, no real trance influence at all

+ Aspyer - Nobody

Pop/trance sounding verse leads to tech house drop, string sounds typical of ASPYER introduced in second half of drop, but not dominant enough IMO

+ Dillon Francis, Vinne - Once again

Unusual track focused on the drop where a repetitive synth note is joined by percussion

+ John Summit - La Danza

Latin vocals meet tech house, nothing new until midway through the track or so with sounds echoing "Thing For You" by Solveig/Guetta

+ Malarkey - Cherub

Happy piano house tune, but nothing too special

+ Quintino - Melody

Catchy melody leads to a big room drop with hints of Future Bounce, little ingenuity

+ Siks, Janee - Belong *

Interesting and effective fusion of contrasting sounds, Janee-style soothing verse leads to Siks-style drop

+ Stadiumx - Out of my Mind

High-energy track with melodic and deep house influences

+ Vini Vici - Sweet Harmony

Not a psy-trance track but brings an interesting blend of sounds, Melbourne shuffle influence in the second half

+ Alison Wonderland - New Day

Low-key trap verses builds into slightly aggressive drop, added melodics in second drop make it an easier listen

+ Fisher & Shermanology - It’s A Killa

Retro tech house, some of Fisher's eccentricity shines through

+ Leftwing:Kody - Mallet *

Energetic tribal house song, highly danceable

+ NuBass - Wired

Bass house song with tingling drop that gets a bit old despite attempted variations

### Mar 4, 2022

+ Above & Beyond, Mat Zo - Always Do

Dark/chilling ambiance, great buildup near the middle

+ Bingo Players - State of Mind

Electro house track, long wait for an energetic drop that goes back into MOGUAI's ACIID-style synths

+ Cheat Codes, Icona Pop - Payback

Typical pop song, not super memorable or energetic

+ Cuebrick - Little Darling *

Energetic future bounce-inspired drop with interesting sound design

+ Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, R3HAB & Prezioso – Shooting Darts

Uninspiring radio-friendly track with subdued slap house influences

+ Fedde Le Grand, Robert Falcon - Heaven (Club Mix)

Track quickly leads into a surprising drop that although interesting does not really fit with the rest of the song. Could have been the basis for a separate track.

+ Jack Wins - Yes! (Dave Summit Remix)

Vocals take center stage, somewhat club-friendly

+ Jeonghyeon - What think is cool *

Energetic track, moving slightly away from Jeonghyeon's typical sound towards some new sounds. A welcome experiment.

+ KREAM - Pressure

Stayed true to the sound that led to the success of Take Control, maybe even too similar, clear Meduza influences

+ Leandro da Silva - Crazy Mistake

Club-friendly tune, nice melodic breakdown in the middle

+ Maddix - The Formula *

Slightly repetitive vocals leading into a powerful driving techno drop

+ MorganJ, Maddow - Lose your Mind

Overall well-produced, obvious contribution from MorganJ despite a slightly less aggressive drop than usual

+ NURKO, JT Roach - Spinnin' Wheels *

Atmospheric melodic bass late-night tune, second drop packs more energy

+ REZZ, Subtronics - Puzzle Box *

Eerie melody builds momentum before a typical REZZ-sounding bass drop that fits nicely with the rest of the track

+ Rudelies - Let me down

Rudelies repeated their recipe at the drop except with a darker-sounding track, was hoping for a bit more at the second drop

+ Sofi Tukker, Mahmut Orhan - Forgive Me

Emotional vocals over Latin-influenced instrumental with string melody, low danseability but powerful listening experience

+ Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano, QG – See

Not the festival tune I expected, nice easy listen

+ Yves V - Imagine you & me

Vocals from "Happy Together" borrowed for a version somewhere between slap house and future bounce but nothing too original

+ Bob Moses - The Silence In Between (Album)

Mostly stay true to the sound their fans are accustomed too, lead single "Time and Time Again" the highlight, "Hanging On" maybe the best new track, some more experimentation in "The Rush" and "Broken Belief"

+ Krewella - The Body Never Lies (Album)

High-energy tracks ranging from drum'n'bass to dubstep, interesting sounds in "Traces" and "No Control"

### Feb 25, 2022
  
+ AC Slater, Curbi - Crave the Bassline
  
Build-up kind-of repetitive/simple, drop better, typical bass house, echoes MorganJ
  
+ ARTY feat. Rozzi - Who Do You Love
  
Nice progression, uplifting, pretty pop-sounding, echoes Sam Feldt
  
+ Chico Rose - Reason (feat. Hadar Adora) 
  
Pop song with deep house progression
  
+ Delerium - Silence (AVIRA Remix)
  
  Minimalist at times, a few interesting new elements but overall similar vibe to Tiesto's version, nice main drop

+ Ferry Corsten, Morgan Page - Wounded

Nice vocals in verse, reminds me of Becky Hill, piano house drop gets into a nice groove but a bit messy with the vocals

+ Galantis, Becky Hill - Run

Uplifting electro pop, no surprises considering Galantis + Becky Hill, nice but not super memorable

+ Giuseppe Ottaviani - Something I Can Dream About

Dark atmosphere, not the uplifting trance I expected from GO, synths at the drop remind me of some Oliver Heldens song I think

+ Julian Jordan - Out Of My Mind *

Energetic bass house drop in Julian Jordan's typical style, Future Rave influence

+ Kryder - Wish *

Nice listen, drop energetic but not overwhelming

+ KSHMR, Divine, Karra - Lion Heart

Similar to KSHMR's newer sound from his last album, sounds a bit uninvested - simple vocals, doesn't flow together so well, rap (?) section comes out of nowhere and doesn't fit IMO, not a huge fan

+ Michael Calfan, Leo Stannard - Better

Happy piano house track, radio-friendly, not super memorable

+ MOGUAI, Ida Corr - Let's go *

Impressive vocals that fit well with the instrumental, nice section in the middle that strips away most of the sounds

+ Nicky Romero, Almero - So much Love

A typical piano house track, surprising from Nicky Romero, not too memorable

+ NUZB - Shake it *

Unique sound, RetroTech?, large contrast between break and drop slightly surprising, nice variety between drops (each better than last)

+ Plastik Funk, Firebeatz - Don't call me Baby (Festival Mix)

Sudden switch into a heavy Future Rave sound, festival-oriented indeed, sounds like a remix made out of necessity

+ Sagan & Gidro - Love In My Heart *

Nice drop, interesting sound design, fun experimentation in second half of drop

+ Sander van Doorn - Breakfast in Vegas *

Good momentum, synths give vibe somewhere between techno and electro house, nice buildup near the end, would fit in a lot of sets

+ Sidepiece - Don't Keep Me Waiting *

Great tech house drop, danseable, small evolution between first and second drops adds some depth

+ SMACK, Rudeejay - La Danse

Some unfulfilled potential, vocals somewhat detract from the experience, otherwise energetic

+ W&W & AXMO feat. Sonja - StarShine (Can't Wait For This To End)

Slight trap influences, typical W&W hardcore track, first drop leans more towards big room compared to hardcore in the second

+ MALAA - Wait *

Bass house track that goes crazy at the drop in typical MALAA style

+ Swedish House Mafia, Sting - Redlight *

Industrial techno, not a classic SHM track, use of Sting's "Roxanne" vocals in second half while tension builds before final drop
