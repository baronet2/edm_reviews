  1. AC Slater, Curbi - Crave the Bassline
  
Build-up kind-of repetitive/simple, drop better, typical bass house, echoes MorganJ
  
  2. ARTY feat. Rozzi - Who Do You Love
  
Nice progression, uplifting, pretty pop-sounding, echoes Sam Feldt
  
  3. Chico Rose - Reason (feat. Hadar Adora) 
  
Pop song with deep house progression
  
  4. Delerium - Silence (AVIRA Remix)
  
  Minimalist at times, a few interesting new elements but overall similar vibe to Tiesto's version, nice main drop

  5. Ferry Corsten, Morgan Page - Wounded

Nice vocals in verse, reminds me of Becky Hill, piano house drop gets into a nice groove but a bit messy with the vocals

  6. Galantis, Becky Hill - Run

Uplifting electro pop, no surprises considering Galantis + Becky Hill, nice but not super memorable

  7. Giuseppe Ottaviani - Something I Can Dream About

Dark atmosphere, not the uplifting trance I expected from GO, synths at the drop remind me of some Oliver Heldens song I think

  8. Julian Jordan - Out Of My Mind *

Energetic bass house drop in Julian Jordan's typical style, Future Rave influence

  9. Kryder - Wish *

Nice listen, drop energetic but not overwhelming

  10. KSHMR, Divine, Karra - Lion Heart

Similar to KSHMR's newer sound from his last album, sounds a bit uninvested - simple vocals, doesn't flow together so well, rap (?) section comes out of nowhere and doesn't fit IMO, not a huge fan

  11. Michael Calfan, Leo Stannard - Better

Happy piano house track, radio-friendly, not super memorable

  12. MOGUAI, Ida Corr - Let's go *

Impressive vocals that fit well with the instrumental, nice section in the middle that strips away most of the sounds

  13. Nicky Romero, Almero - So much Love

A typical piano house track, surprising from Nicky Romero, not too memorable

  14. NUZB - Shake it *

Unique sound, RetroTech?, large contrast between break and drop slightly surprising, nice variety between drops (each better than last)

  15. Plastik Funk, Firebeatz - Don't call me Baby (Festival Mix)

Sudden switch into a heavy Future Rave sound, festival-oriented indeed, sounds like a remix made out of necessity

  16. Sagan & Gidro - Love In My Heart *

Nice drop, interesting sound design, fun experimentation in second half of drop

  17. Sander van Doorn - Breakfast in Vegas *

Good momentum, synths give vibe somewhere between techno and electro house, nice buildup near the end, would fit in a lot of sets

  18. Sidepiece - Don't Keep Me Waiting *

Great tech house drop, danseable, small evolution between first and second drops adds some depth

  19. SMACK, Rudeejay - La Danse

Some unfulfilled potential, vocals somewhat detract from the experience, otherwise energetic

  20. W&W & AXMO feat. Sonja - StarShine (Can't Wait For This To End)

Slight trap influences, typical W&W hardcore track, first drop leans more towards big room compared to hardcore in the second

  21. MALAA - Wait *

Bass house track that goes crazy at the drop in typical MALAA style

  22. Swedish House Mafia, Sting - Redlight *

Industrial techno, not a classic SHM track, use of Sting's "Roxanne" vocals in second half while tension builds before final drop
